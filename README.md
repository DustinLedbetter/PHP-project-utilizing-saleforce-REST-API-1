# PHP-project-utilizing-saleforce-REST-API-1
A php project that uses several files for Oauth 2.0 verification and token use for salesforce REST API

This project requires several files to verify user without saving the login credentials in the project.

This was found in the salesforce documentation, which is extremely large and not easy to dig through. I am saving this here for future use as needed.
